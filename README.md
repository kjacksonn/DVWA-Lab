# 🔐 DVWA Lab – Vulnerability Testing on Kali Linux

This project demonstrates how to set up and test common web vulnerabilities using **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)** on **Kali Linux**. It was built as a personal cybersecurity lab for practicing hands-on exploitation in a safe environment.

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Required Packages
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apache2 php php-mysqli mariadb-server git -y
````

### 2. Clone DVWA

```bash
git clone https://github.com/digininja/DVWA.git /var/www/html/dvwa
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/dvwa
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/dvwa
```

### 3. Start Apache and MySQL

```bash
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl start mysql
```

### 4. Configure the MySQL Database

```bash
sudo mysql -u root
```

Inside MySQL:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE dvwa;
CREATE USER 'dvwauser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'dvwapass';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON dvwa.* TO 'dvwauser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

### 5. Edit DVWA Configuration

```bash
sudo cp /var/www/html/dvwa/config/config.inc.php.dist /var/www/html/dvwa/config/config.inc.php
sudo nano /var/www/html/dvwa/config/config.inc.php
```

Set the following values:

```php
$_DVWA[ 'db_user' ] = 'dvwauser';
$_DVWA[ 'db_password' ] = 'dvwapass';
```

### 6. Access DVWA in Browser

Navigate to:

```
http://localhost/dvwa
```

Default login:

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `password`

Then click **"Create/Reset Database"** on the home page.
